\section{Geoclient Description}{


The Geoclient API is a RESTful web service interface to the NYC Department
of City Planningâ€™s Geosupport system developed by the Department of
Information Technology and Telecommunications GIS/Mapping unit. Geosupport
is a mainframe-based geocoding system used by NYC government. Geosupport
provides coordinate and geographic attributes for supported input locations
(address, intersection, blockface). Geoclient exposes the most widely used
Geosupport functions through simple and easy to use REST representations.

\section{Geoclient Service Usage Guidelines}{


The Geoclient API is a free geocoding service offered by the City of New
York for use by the general public. Access to the service requires
registering for a free account on this website and requesting an access
key. Due to rapidly increasing usage of Geoclient, we are seeing a
commensurate decline in overall application availability based our current
contractual resource allowance from third party platform services. While we
work towards increasing this capacity, we are forced to set service usage
guidelines.

From this point forward, the following service usage guidelines apply:
\itemize{
\item Maximum of 2,500 requests per minute;
\item Maximum of 500,000 requests per day.
}

Note that these are guidelines and not hard limits. However, if we see
applications continually exceeding these limits, we will attempt to notify
the account administrator based on contact information provided in the
sign-up forms. If corrective action is not taken, we will then set whatever
limits we deem necessary to provide equal resources averaged by all active
accounts. Moving forward, as we increase capacity, we may adjust the usage
guidelines.

By default all functions in this package adhere to these guidelines.
However, both restrictions can be overriden by setting the arguments
\code{rate_limit} and \code{cap_daily_requests} to \code{FALSE}.
